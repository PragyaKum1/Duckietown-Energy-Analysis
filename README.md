This is a WIP: The code here is AI generated (I do know what it is doing) and it is a very basic model just to see if we can gather and analyze energy used from the Duckiematrix simulator.
It has extremely high loss and is not accurate in the slightest.
I will continue to work on it and update as we get more information from the simulator and improve the model.
